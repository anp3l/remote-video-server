## Description

A standalone **Video Resource Server** built for secure video management, processing, and HLS streaming.

Originally developed as part of the **Remote Video Library** ecosystem, this service is intentionally designed to be **reusable as-is** in other projects that need a private video backend (upload, transcoding, storage, streaming) with stateless authentication.

**Key responsibilities:**
- Validates **RS256 JWT** access tokens issued by an external Identity Provider (e.g., the Remote Video Library Auth Server).
- Handles video upload, transcoding, and persisted storage.
- Serves HLS playback securely via **HMAC-signed URLs** (separate from JWT auth).

> **Architecture note**
> This service is stateless with respect to user credentials: it does not manage passwords or sessions. It relies on cryptographic verification of JWTs via an RSA Public Key (provided via environment variable or file).
---

## Authentication Standard (JWT Requirements)

To use this Video Server with your own Identity Provider (IdP), your JWTs must meet the following standard:

1. **Algorithm:** `RS256` (RSA Signature with SHA-256).
2. **Required Claims:**
   `userId` (string): Unique identifier for the user (used for data isolation).
3. **Verification:** You must provide the IdP's RSA Public Key to this server (via `PUBLIC_KEY_BASE64` environment variable or `public.pem` file).

**Example Payload:**
```
{
  "userId": "65a123456789abcdef123456",  // MongoDB ObjectId
  "username": "johndoe",
  "iat": 1704239022,                     // Issued At (Timestamp)
  "exp": 1704843822                      // Expiration (7 days later)
}
```

## Features

- 🔐 **RSA Token Verification**: Validates JWTs signed by the external Auth Server
- 🍪 **HttpOnly Cookie Auth**: JWT is transmitted via HttpOnly cookie, never exposed to JavaScript
- 🛡️ **CSRF Protection**: Double-submit cookie pattern (csrf-csrf) on all mutating endpoints
- 👤 **User Isolation**: Each user accesses only their own videos
- 🎬 **HLS Streaming**: Adaptive bitrate (1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p)
- ⚡ **Async Processing**: Background transcoding with status polling
- 🖼️ **Thumbnails**: Static, custom, and animated previews (WebP)
- 💾 **Persisted Storage**: Local volume mapping for video persistence
- 📄 **Documentation**: Full Swagger/OpenAPI UI

## Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/anp3l/remote-video-server.git
cd remote-video-server
```

### 2. Configuration

1. **Environment File:**
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. **Generate HMAC Secret:**
   Used to sign streaming URLs, preventing unauthorized sharing or deep-linking.
   Run this command and paste the output into `STREAM_SECRET` in `.env`:

   ```
   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"
   ```
3. **Configure Auth Public Key (Crucial):**
   Get the Base64 string of the public key (from the Auth Server) and add it to your `.env`:
   ```
   PUBLIC_KEY_BASE64=... (paste the long base64 string here)
   ```
   (Alternative: Place a `public.pem` file in the project root for local dev fallback).


### 3. Choose your Setup Method

#### Option A: Docker (Recommended)
Includes **MongoDB** and **FFmpeg** pre-configured. 

> **Note:** Ensure `PUBLIC_KEY_BASE64` is set in your `.env` file before starting.

```
docker-compose up --build
```

**Docker Commands Cheat Sheet:**
```
#Start (and rebuild if needed)
docker-compose up --build

#Stop containers
docker-compose down

#Full Reset (clean images & volumes)
docker-compose down -v --rmi all
```

#### Option B: Manual Setup
Requires **Node.js v18+**, **MongoDB**, and **FFmpeg**.

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. **Install FFmpeg:**
   - Ensure `ffmpeg` with libx264/AAC support is in your PATH.
   - Verify with: `ffmpeg -version`

3. **Start MongoDB:**
   - Ensure MongoDB is running locally on port 27017.

4. **Start Server:**
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Usage & Access

Once the server is running, you can interact with it using the following details.

### 📍 Access Points

- **API Root:** [http://localhost:3070](http://localhost:3070/)
    
- **Swagger Documentation:** http://localhost:3070/api-docs
    

### 📂 Data Persistence

- **Docker:** Videos are mapped to the `./uploads` directory on your host machine.
    
- **Manual:** Videos are saved in the `uploads/` folder inside the project root.
    

### 🔑 How to Authenticate (Testing)

This server acts as a Resource Server and **does not issue tokens**.

Authentication uses an **HttpOnly cookie** (`accessToken`) set by the Auth Server after login. The cookie is sent automatically by the browser on every request — no manual header needed.

**Flow for mutating endpoints** (POST, PATCH, DELETE):

1. **Login** via the Auth Server → `accessToken` cookie is set automatically.

2. **Get a CSRF token** before any write operation:
   ```
   GET /videos/csrf-token
   ```
   Response: `{ "csrfToken": "<token>" }`

3. **Include the CSRF token** as a header in the request:
   ```
   X-CSRF-Token: <csrfToken>
   ```

> **Note for Swagger UI:** Cookie-based auth requires the browser to have the `accessToken` cookie already set (from the Auth Server on the same domain). The Swagger UI "Authorize" button is not used for cookie auth — authenticate via the Auth Server first, then use Swagger normally.

## Video Processing & Streaming

### Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABR)

Videos are automatically transcoded into **4 quality levels** for optimal streaming experience:

| Quality | Resolution | Video Bitrate | Use Case                  |
|---------|------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| 1080p   | 1920x1080  | 5000 kbps    | Desktop, fiber connection |
| 720p    | 1280x720   | 2800 kbps    | Desktop, good connection  |
| 480p    | 854x480    | 1400 kbps    | Mobile, moderate connection |
| 360p    | 640x360    | 800 kbps     | Mobile, slow connection   |

**How it works:**  
- Videos are processed into HLS format with a master playlist named `{id}_master.m3u8`  
- The player automatically switches quality based on network conditions  
- Seamless quality transitions without buffering  
- Audio is automatically detected and processed; videos without audio are supported  

**Technical details:**  
- Codec: H.264 (libx264) with AAC audio  
- Segment duration: 4 seconds  
- GOP size: 48 frames for better seeking  
- Preset: medium (balance between quality and encoding speed)  

### Storage Requirements

Due to ABR, each video requires **~3-4 times** the original size:  
- Example: 100 MB original video → ~300-400 MB total storage  
- Each quality level generates separate `.ts` segments  
- Storage scales with video duration and quality settings  

### Secure Token System

Streaming playback is protected by **Signed URLs** (HMAC-SHA256), separate from the main JWT auth. 
- The `STREAM_SECRET` in `.env` is used to sign these URLs.
- Tokens expire after 15 minutes (default) and must be refreshed via the API. 
- Frontend refreshes tokens when less than 5 minutes remain  
- Refresh endpoint available at `POST /videos/:id/refresh-token` (JWT protected)

## API Endpoints

**Note**: Endpoints marked **(cookie)** require the `accessToken` HttpOnly cookie. Endpoints marked **(cookie + CSRF)** also require the `X-CSRF-Token` header (obtain it from `GET /videos/csrf-token`). Streaming/thumbnail endpoints use **signed URL** query parameters instead.

| Method | Endpoint                       | Description                            |
| ------ | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/videos/csrf-token`           | Get CSRF token (required before any write) |
| POST   | `/videos`                      | Upload video (cookie + CSRF)           |
| GET    | `/videos`                      | List your videos (cookie)              |
| GET    | `/videos/:id`                  | Video details (cookie)                 |
| PATCH  | `/videos/:id`                  | Edit metadata (cookie + CSRF)          |
| PATCH  | `/videos/thumb/custom/:id`     | Upload custom thumbnail (cookie + CSRF) |
| DELETE | `/videos/:id`                  | Delete video + assets (cookie + CSRF)  |
| POST   | `/videos/:id/signed-url`       | Generate signed URLs for streaming and thumbnails (cookie + CSRF) |
| POST   | `/videos/:id/refresh-token`    | Refresh signed URL for extended playback (cookie + CSRF) |
| GET    | `/videos/stream/:id`           | HLS master playlist (signed URL: expires, signature, uid) |
| GET    | `/videos/stream/:id/:file?`    | HLS segments/playlists (signed URL: expires, signature, uid) |
| GET    | `/videos/thumb/signed/:id`     | Static thumbnail WebP (signed URL: expires, signature, uid) |
| GET    | `/videos/thumb/static/:id`     | Static thumbnail WebP (cookie)         |
| GET    | `/videos/thumb/animated/:id`   | Animated thumbnail WebP (cookie)       |
| GET    | `/videos/status/:id`           | Processing status (cookie)             |
| GET    | `/videos/duration/:id`         | Video duration in seconds (cookie)     |
| GET    | `/videos/download/:id`         | Original video download with HTTP 206 support (cookie) |

## Video Upload Flow

1. **Upload** a video via `POST /videos`.  
   - The server responds immediately with basic video metadata and sets `videoStatus` to `"inProgress"`.  
   - The uploaded file is saved and referenced in the database for immediate queries.

2. **Asynchronous background processing** starts post-upload:  
   - Full metadata extraction (including duration and audio tracks)  
   - Static thumbnail generation (snapshot at 4 seconds)  
   - Video transcoding to 4 HLS adaptive bitrate quality levels  
   - Animated thumbnail generation (3 seconds preview GIF/WebP)  

3. Clients may **poll video status** via `/videos/status/:id` to track processing progress in real time.

4. On successful processing completion, `videoStatus` is updated to `"uploaded"`, signifying readiness for streaming.
